<b>User's browser family:</b><br>
<br>
I implemented two different methods to find the information about User's browser family. <br>
<br>
<b>The first method:</b><br>
Parsing the characters obtained from the User Agent via <b>navigator.userAgent</b>. 
Each browser will have information in the User Agent that contains browser features such as browser's name, browser's version, etc.
I rely on these features to distinguish between browsers and give information about the User's browser family. 
List of Browsers that First Method Support: Chrome (Desktop & Mobile version), Firefox (Desktop version), Safari (Desktop & Mobile version), Opera (Desktop version), Internet Explorer and Edge.<br>
<br>
<b>The second method:</b><br> Distinguishes based on the unique features of each browser with Javascript Objects (Windows Object and HTML DOM Document Object).
List of Browsers that Second Method Support (Desktop version only): Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer and Edge.<br>
<br>
<b>In addition, I also fingerprint the following information:</b> <br>
Browser's Version (based on User Agent)<br>
Number of plugins installed (based on navigator Object)<br>
List of Plugins (based on navigator Object)<br>
Operating System (based on User Agent) - <b>Support: Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS</b><br>
Cookies enable (based on navigator Object)<br>
Screen Resolution (based on screen object)<br>
Color Resolution (based on screen object)<br>
Browser's Language (based on Navigator Object)<br>
<br>
<b>Identifier:</b><br>
The identifier is based on extracting special characters from the acquired information of Browser's Name, Browser's Version, Operating System, Number of plugins, Cookies enabled, Screen Resolution and Browser's Language.
